This crude little app is all about being type-safe and thusly written in
TypeScript. For now, the Yelp API returns top rated 🍕 pizza joints and their
reviews in LA 🌴. It doesn't do much but it's all 💪 typed and uses:

- React 
- Redux 
  - Redux-Saga for async tasks
- React-Router
- Redux and Router middlewares
- emotion.js for styled components
